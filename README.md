CAT-like string filter view
---------------------------

An experiment to create a string filter view akin to those found in CAT tools like memoQ. I am writing a number of versions of this in order to explore different ways of doing things and trying to find the 'best' approach for larger projects. For now I have written this in jQuery, Bacon.js and Mithril.js.

* Source and Target strings have one input field each
* RegEx entered into a field hides non-matching strings

**TODO**:
Add diff-highlighting, to highlight the text corresponding to input string

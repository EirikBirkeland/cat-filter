CAT-like string filter view
---------------------------

An experiment to create a string filter view akin to those found in CAT tools like memoQ.

* Source and Target strings have one input field each
* RegEx entered into a field hides non-matching strings

TODO:
Add diff-highlighting, to highlight the text corresponding to input string

CAT-like text filter view
---------------------------

An experiment to create a string filter view akin to those found in CAT tools like memoQ. I am writing a number of versions of this in order to explore different ways of doing things and try to find the "best" approach for larger projects. For now I have written this in jQuery, Bacon.js and Mithril.js.

Mithril is the clear winner!

**TODO**:
Add diff-highlighting, to highlight any text corresponding to input string
